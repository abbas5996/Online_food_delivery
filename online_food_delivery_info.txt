--------------------------------------------------
3. DATA QUALITY NOTES
--------------------------------------------------
- The dataset contains NULL values in delivery_time_minutes and rating columns.
- NULL values represent real-life scenarios such as cancelled orders or missing feedback.
- Cancelled orders are identified using the order_status column.

--------------------------------------------------
4. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TABLES
--------------------------------------------------
- customers.customer_id -> orders.customer_id
- restaurants.restaurant_id -> orders.restaurant_id
- delivery_partners.delivery_partner_id -> orders.delivery_partner_id

These relationships allow multi-table joins for advanced SQL analysis.

STEP 2: BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS & KPIs

Business Objectives:
- Reduce delivery delays
- Improve customer satisfaction
- Identify low-performing cities and restaurants

Key Requirements:
1. Analyze delivery performance
	- Delivery late kyun ho rahi hai?
	- Kitne orders delay ho rahe hain?

2. City-wise order and delay analysis
	- Kaunse city me delivery slow hai?
	- Kaunse city me orders zyada aa rahe hain?

3. Restaurant performance evaluation
	- Kaunse restaurants zyada delay kar rahe?
	- Kaunse restaurants revenue generate kar rahe?

4. Customer rating analysis
	- Low rating kyun aa rahi hai?
	- Delivery delay ka rating pe impact hai ya nahi?

5. Order trend analysis
	-Peak hours kaunse hain?
	-Weekend vs weekday difference?

6. Cancellation analysis
	- Orders cancel kyun ho rahe?
	- Cancellation rate kitni hai?

Defined KPIs:
- Average delivery time
- Delivery delay percentage
- Cancellation rate
- Average order value
- Customer satisfaction score
- Orders per city


STEP 3: DATA CLEANING & PREPARATION

1. Performed data audit to check total rows and NULL values.
2. Identified NULL values in delivery_time_minutes and rating.
3. Cancelled orders were excluded from delivery performance analysis
   but included for cancellation rate calculation.
4. NULL delivery_time_minutes in delivered orders marked for
   city-wise average replacement (decision documented).
5. NULL ratings were ignored in average rating calculation
   to avoid bias.
6. Checked for duplicates and outliers.
7. Created a logical filtered dataset using views instead of deleting data.

STEP 4: KPI CALCULATION USING SQL

1. Calculated total number of orders.
2. Analyzed order status distribution.
3. Calculated cancellation rate percentage.
4. Calculated average delivery time excluding cancelled orders.
5. Calculated delivery delay percentage.
6. Calculated average order value (AOV).
7. Calculated average customer satisfaction score.
8. Performed city-wise order analysis using joins.
9. Analyzed city-wise average delivery time.
10. Identified top-performing restaurants based on revenue and delivery time.


STEP 5: BUSINESS INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Identified city-wise delivery delays.
2. Found correlation between delivery time and customer ratings.
3. Analyzed restaurant performance based on revenue and speed.
4. Identified peak order hours.
5. Analyzed cancellation trends city-wise.
6. Provided actionable business recommendations to improve operations.
